# CS-205---Project-2
This program is written in C++. To run the program, please compile the source code using `g++ project2.cpp`, then run the executable by using the command `./a.out`. You will be prompted to enter the name of the file to test. The datasets which I have been assigned are:
- CS205_SP_2022_Largetestdata__1.txt
- CS205_SP_2022_SMALLtestdata__63.txt

You will then be prompted for the name of the file to write the output to. Please feel free to enter any file name you like.

Finally, you will be prompted to enter your choice of algorithm to use for feature selection. Upon selection, the output will be written both to console and to the file you specified.
